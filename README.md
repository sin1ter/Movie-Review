## Features

* User Authentication: Secure user registration and login using Django's authentication system and token-based authentication with DRF.

* Reviews & Ratings: Users can submit reviews and rate movies on a scale of 1 to 5. Only authenticated users can post reviews.

* Permissions & Throttling: Built-in permissions to ensure only authorized users can perform certain actions, with rate-limiting to protect against abuse.

* Filtering & Searching: Easily filter movies by various criteria (e.g., ratings, title) and search through reviews.

* Comprehensive Unit Tests: Ensure the integrity of the application with extensive unit tests for all major functionalities.
